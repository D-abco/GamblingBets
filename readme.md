# What is GamblingBets?

GamblingBets is a Balatro mod that adds a casino-style betting system to the shop. You can wager your money on predicting what poker hand you'll play in the next round, with payouts based on hand difficulty and betting odds.

## How It Works

### Betting System

- **Shop Integration**: Betting controls are built into the shop interface
- **Hand Selection**: Choose from 3 randomly generated poker hands each shop visit
- **Bet Amount**: Wager $5 minimum up to all your money
- **Payout Odds**: Dynamic odds from 1:1 to 3.5:1 based on difficulty

### How payout works

Payout is determined by your earnings + your base bet
Your earnings are determined by the following formula:

```earnings = (bet/ratio) + bet```

What this would look like if you were to bet $20 on Two Pair

```earnings = (20/2.5) + 20```
```earnings = 28```
In the case of a decimal, which we would get above integers are rounded *UP*


### Available Hands & Payouts

| Hand Type | Payout Ratio | Max Payout | Winning Conditions |
|-----------|--------------|------------|-------------------|
| Two Pair | 2.5:1 | $25 | Two Pair, Full House, Four of a Kind |
| Three of a Kind | 2:1 | $25 | Three of a Kind, Full House, Four of a Kind |
| Straight | 1.8:1 | $50 | Straight, Straight Flush, Royal Flush |
| Flush | 1.5:1 | $50 | Flush, Flush House, Straight Flush, Royal Flush, Flush Five |
| Full House | 1.3:1 | $50 | Full House, Flush House |
| Four of a Kind | 1.1:1 | $100 | Four of a Kind |
| Straight Flush | 1:1 | $100 | Straight Flush, Royal Flush |
